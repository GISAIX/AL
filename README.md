Active Learning Library
==
# pyAL
--------------
pyAL is an python library that implements common active learning strategies. The project is currently developed by the members of the Machine Learning Lab at IIT: (http://ml.cs.iit.edu). 

Currently supported strategies:

1. Random sampling
2. Uncertainty sampling by Lewis and Gale, 1994. A sequential algorithm for training text classifiers. Proceedings of the 17th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval.
3. Query-by-committee by Seung et al, 1992. Query by committee. Proceedings of the fifth annual workshop on Computational learning theory.
4. Expected error reduction by Roy and McCallum, 2001. Toward optimal active learning through monte carlo estimation of error reduction. Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Conference on Machine Learning.
