Implementation of common active learning strategies. The project is currently developed by the members of the Machine Learning Lab at IIT: http://ml.cs.iit.edu. 

Currently supported strategies:

1. Random sampling
2. Uncertainty sampling
3. Query-by-committee
4. Expected error reduction
5. Log-gain

Current limitations:

1. The code currently assumes binary classification.
2. The code works with a train-test split.
